Bare bone Charles Swab API client
Likely will not develop this further, part of a larger project.

Wanted to share in case it helps anyone :)

In the charles swab portal, get your application key and secret.
Paste them into the script.

If you get a 404 error, its likely because you need to go into the swab portal and authorize your application to access that part of the api.
